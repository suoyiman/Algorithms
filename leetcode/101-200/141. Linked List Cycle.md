Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

![[_resources/141. Linked List Cycle/16c3a56418b49dac29c5d712e349991f_MD5.png]]

**Input:** head = \[3,2,0,-4\], pos = 1
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

**Example 2:**

![[_resources/141. Linked List Cycle/8867e0c68637e56d8c0f9660694c577c_MD5.png]]

**Input:** head = \[1,2\], pos = 0
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

**Example 3:**

![[_resources/141. Linked List Cycle/d0c0a0bc9c94ef9614530718ffeb01df_MD5.png]]

**Input:** head = \[1\], pos = -1
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.
