Given the `root` of a binary tree, *check whether it is a mirror of itself* (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

**Example 1:**

![[_resources/101. Symmetric Tree/e74bef3c6216c764dbd4bedf8f46cb62_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![[_resources/101. Symmetric Tree/7b6dbb6f96b8c843f6df3cb390487fa2_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

 

**Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
