You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. *Recover the tree without changing its structure*.

**Follow up:** A solution using `O(n)` space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

 

**Example 1:**

![[_resources/99. Recover Binary Search Tree/0c82d4f3e53f0675bcb02a74b4dbc62b_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

**Example 2:**

![[_resources/99. Recover Binary Search Tree/613cd2e07fd6117a8aff31ddd709a117_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`
