Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m x n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

 

**Example 1:**

![[_resources/74. Search a 2D Matrix/c77e313b4e7f917805ae54bd0d02ae52_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![[_resources/74. Search a 2D Matrix/38742aa98605dfc1669b6a9a0d10cb5a_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4`
