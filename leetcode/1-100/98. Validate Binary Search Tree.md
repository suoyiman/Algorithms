Given the `root` of a binary tree, *determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)*.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

 

**Example 1:**

![[_resources/98. Validate Binary Search Tree/fc6f30e81f274bf95dc1b8ad5884d80c_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![[_resources/98. Validate Binary Search Tree/c8d73531dae4390d1387304200634ba4_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1`
