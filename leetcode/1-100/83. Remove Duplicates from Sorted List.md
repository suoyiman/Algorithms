Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, *delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once*. Return *the linked list **sorted** as well*.

 

**Example 1:**

![[_resources/83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List/993ddf70e5535bb700c208ad5c20e055_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: head = [1,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**

![[_resources/83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List/38e0cb86a74da6a8d74283b4b4aaefc4_MD5.jpg]]

```
Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 300]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The list is guaranteed to be **sorted** in ascending order.
